First Tech Challenge Webcam code

This code controls a REV Robotics robot to detect and follow yellow objects and then shoot a nerf ball at it. When the robot centers on the yellow object
it spools up the flywheels needed to launch the ball.

This project was solo created over the course of one semester. Access to the robot itself was a bit limited with only two 90 minute time slots a week.

The project is much cooler if you take a look at the videos of the robot in action.
